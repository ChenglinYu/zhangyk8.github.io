title: "Invictus"
excerpt: "An inspiring poem written by by the Victorian era English poet William Ernest Henley. 
This poem invigorated the Nobel Prize Laureate, Nelson Mandela, to withstand his torturous incarceration but still forgave those who spared no effort to take his life after he was elected as the President of South Africa."

<br/>

Out of the night that covers me <br/>
    Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br/>
I thank whatever gods may be<br/>
    For my unconquerable soul.<br/>
  
<br/>
In the fell clutch of circumstance,<br/>
  I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br/>
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br/>
  My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br/>
  
  <br/>
Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br/>
  Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br/>
And yet the menace of the years<br/>
  Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.<br/>
  
  <br/>
It matters how strait the gate,<br/>
  How charged with punishments the scroll,<br/>
I am the master of my fate,<br/>
  I am the captain of my soul.<br/>
