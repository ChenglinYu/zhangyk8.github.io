Research Experience
======
* Summer 2017: Summer PhD Research Experience Program
  * Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University
  * Duties included: 
    1. Implemented the Grow-shink (constrain-based) Bayesian networks structure learning algorithm in order to discover the causal structure between demographic features and 2016 presidential election results on the county level
    2. Proposed a _two step clustering-based_ strategy for Bayesian network structure learning (See publications for details)
  * Supervisor: Professor Jiming Liu
  
* Sep 2017 - Present: Multi-model Brain-inspired Intelligence Laboratory
  * School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University
  * Duties included:
    1. Conducted a nested 3-fold cross-validation based on the rank of cognitive scores to determine the optimal parameters for the elastic-net model
    2. Quantified accuracies of the prediction by computing the normalized MAE (Mean Absolute Errors) and Pearson’s correlations
    3.  Further improved the prediction results via random forests and random kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) models
